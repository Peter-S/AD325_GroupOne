The deliverables for Sprint 0 will be:
- Create a GitHub repository with all team mates added as collaborators. (Will demo in class)
- In your group repo's README.md file, include a brief write-up of your what your project will be. 
- An image file that shows wireframes for all planned screens of your application (Simple sketches are fine)
- Create 10 user stories to be considered for development in Sprint 1 (Week 3) (Use GitHub Issues for this)

To submit, one person from the group should submit a link to the project github repository to notify me that all the sprint 0 work has been completed. (Commits to the repository for Sprint 0 work added after Wednesday 1/16 @ midnight will be considered late work.)
